### Properties
When existing widgets are modified the new properties should be a separate category ex. Extended to make clear that these are parameters that are new or different from the standard widget.

### Events and Actions
When existing widgets are modified the new events and actions name should indicate that these are new or different from the standard widget. Ex. add an "Ext" at the end.
