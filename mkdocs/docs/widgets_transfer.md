All file devices require a file device configuration. The file device configuration can be found in the target system configuration. If you want to allow access to "everyone" make sure that the anonymous user also has the role of "BR_Anonymous"

#### Properties

**maxFileSize**

This is the maximum size of the transferred file. Larger files will generate an error. The maxiumum value may vary on PLC performance and should be between 1.000 - 10.000.000 bytes. Values larger than 10 MB will be rejected.

#### Additional Actions
The widget derives all actions from the button widget.

**Download**
This action downloads a file from the PLC to the client.

* filePath - Full path to the file including the device name, filename and extension. Do **NOT** add 'FileDevice:' before the device name!

Example

mappDir/screenshot.png

mappDir is the device name specified in the target system configuration.

**Upload**
This action uploads a file and saves it on the PLC.

* filePath - Directory where the file should be saved. Do **NOT** add 'FileDevice:' before the device name!

**FileSaved**

This event is called when the file was saved on the PLC after an upload action. Returns the full path of the file (filePath).

**FileDownloaded**

This event is called when the file was downloaded successful.
